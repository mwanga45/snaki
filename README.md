# Snaki - The Classic Snake Game Reimagined

## Introduction
Snaki, created by Tachera Sasi, is a reimagined version of the classic snake game. It combines the nostalgia of the original game with the modern touch of React Native swipe gestures.

## How to Play
1. Swipe up, down, left, or right to control the movement of the snake.
2. Guide the snake to eat the apples that randomly appear on the game board.
3. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer by one segment.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
5. Aim to achieve the highest score by eating as many apples as possible!
